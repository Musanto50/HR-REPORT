# HR-REPORT
## Introduction
Greetings from the fascinating field of data analysis! Using the extensive Adventure Works dataset, we do a thorough analysis of employee in this documentation. Our analysis seeks to provide important patterns and insights from the data, illuminating employee behavior, advancement, and reduction. Come along on this trip with us as we work our way through the numbers to uncover insights that might inform strategy and improve employee productivity.
## DATA SOURCE
You can access the  data to this project [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFKNSmO8oyA)
## TASK
1.	AGE TREND: The proportion of workers at varying employment levels based on gender and age.
2.	WORKFORCE ANALYSIS: The number of workers in each job category who will be promoted and laid off.
3.	BENEFICIARIES: Recognizing employees which are due for both promotion and retrenchment which are meant to get benefit from the organization.
4.	PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS: Performance Analysis: Highlighting the productivity of employees in terms of working overtime and performance rating.
## DATA PREPARATION AND TRANSFORMATION 
I took care to include crucial calculations that would support our research when I organized the tables. These computations comprised important metrics such as the total number of workers, the proportion of men and women, the number of workers who are due for promotion and those who are not, the number of workers who are scheduled for layoffs and those who will continue to work, and the age range of workers. Including these computations was a wise decision because it provided us with more methods to interpret the data and extract relevant information. An extensive summary of the number of male and female employees correlated with job level and age group was produced during the visualization process. Using a doughnut chart, the amount of employees who will be promoted, not be promoted, laid off, and remain on service is shown on a card. The calculated number of employee to remain on service and to the retrenched are added as tooltip on the bar chat of the age bracket and total employee to display number of employee that will be retrenched in each age bracket.
